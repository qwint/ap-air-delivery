# Air Delivery Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- The Client folder from the release
- A web browser

## Configuring your YAML file

There are currently no options for Air Delivery, but a YAML is still required.

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

See the guide on setting up a basic YAML at the Archipelago setup
guide: [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your options by visiting the [Air Delivery Player Settings Page](../player-options)

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

### Launching the Air Delivery Client

The index.html file in the Client folder can be opened in any web browser, then submit the Hostname, Port, and Name for the connection

An example:
* Hostname: archipelago.gg
* Port: 38281
* Name: Player1

You will then see a `Connected` message showing that you have connected properly, and you can continue to play the game.

### Running the game

The game can be played before or after Connecting, but make sure if you are switching slots to reset the game so that your inventory and sent locations are not carried over into the new slot
