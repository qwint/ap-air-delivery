A tiny metroidvania where you explore the floating island to collect all the missing packages! Extra locations have been added to all deliveries instead of just those who give items in vanilla, one for just chatting and one for getting their package delivered.
The goal is to get back to your air baloon and continue your route (and hopefully deliver all the packages as you go.)


The version of Air Delivery shipped with the AP integration has been modified to use the GPIO layer to communicate with archipelago.js, along with the modifications to the Player and NPCs to add the additional randomizable Locations.
